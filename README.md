# StreamLogix-Simulation

StreamLogix-Simulation is a microservices-based simulation platform designed to model and manage logistics operations. Built with .NET Core and Docker, it provides a scalable and modular architecture for simulating various logistics processes.

## 🚀 Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: Comprises multiple services such as `AssetService`, `AuthService`, `Client`, `CompanyService`, `MovementService`, `NotificationService`, `ShipmentService`, and `SimulationService`.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizes a dedicated database project (`StreamLogixDBProject`) for data management.
- **Docker Support**: Includes a `docker-compose.yml` file for easy containerization and deployment.
- **Service Communication**: Facilitates inter-service communication for cohesive simulation workflows.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Backend**: .NET Core
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Database**: SQL Server (assumed based on project structure)

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FasttrackNishant/StreamLogix-Simulation.git
   cd StreamLogix-Simulation
   ```

2. **Build and Run Containers**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will build and start all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. **Accessing the Services**

   - Services will be available on their respective ports as defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - Ensure that the services are properly configured to communicate with each other.

## 🧒 Running Simulations

- Once the services are up and running, you can initiate simulations through the `SimulationService`.
- Ensure that all required data and configurations are in place for accurate simulation results.
